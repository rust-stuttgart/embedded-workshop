# Introduction
(feel free to skip sections you know about)

## Scope

The following topics are covered in the core chapters:

- How to write, build and flash an embedded program.
- Basic operation of a GPIO, ubiquitous in microcontrollers.

## Non-goals

- Teaching electric circuit theory or electronics.
  We'll cover the minimum required to understand how some devices work along the way.

- Covering Rustic, low level details.
  We won't be talking about linker scripts, the boot process,
  or how to glue those two into a minimally working Rust program.
